WARNING:pyami:['goal of food manufacturers [1]. New processes must be designed to meet the required food product', 'safety or shelf-life demands, and additional hurdles for microorganisms should be introduced.

WARNING:pyami:['Therefore, new methods and additives should be found to prolong service life and to improve the', 'safety of foods.

One of these', 'methods is bioactive packaging by the use of natural compounds with multifunctional properties both', 'to achieve the protection of food and to improve the health of consumers. The concern regarding', 'safety issues of the synthetic antimicrobial agents has led to the use of essential oils (EOs), which', 'represent eco-friendly alternatives to chemicals. Essential oils (also called volatile oils) are oily liquids', 'obtained from plant materials (ﬂowers, buds, seeds, leaves, twigs, bark, herbs, wood, fruits, and', 'roots).

For the analyzed essential oils, IC50 is in the μg/mL range assigned to a very good antioxidant activity [55]. From the selected essential oils, the clove oil is by far the most radical scavenging active, with an IC50 of 8 μg/mL. The antioxidant activity was associated with the presence of phenolic compounds in the composition of essential oils, as determined by the Folin–Ciocâlteu method and the GC-FID technique and ORAC values. The antioxidant activity varies in the following order: clove oil > thyme oil > rosemary oil >> tea tree oil. Based on the radical scavenging tests, the clove oil is the most effective antioxidant is recommended for further such applications. 2.6. Preliminary Results on the Use of Encapsulated Essential Oils into Chitosan Films as Food  Packaging Material The stability of the chitosan/essential oil emulsions was sustained by dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis, which showed a main particle population with low dimensions (Figure 11), with the distribution showing, in the low dimension range, a single peak and a polydispersity index (PDI)-approached value of 1.0 (Table 7). The chitosan/essential oil emulsions contain two kinds of particle populations: the first one is very small, where d = 5 nm for the chitosan solution and 11–70 (350) nm for the emulsion containing EOs, and the second contains larger particles of 850 nm for CS and 2500–8800 nm for CS/EOs emulsions. Oils are probably concentrated around CS particles because of aggregation.  (a) (b)Figure 11.

(a) (b)Figure 12. SEM images of (a) CS and (b) CS/rosemary or clove oil/T80 films at a 2000× magnification It can be observed that the surfaces are very smooth, and, by essential oil incorporation, very small particles are evidenced at high magnification. The good homogeneity of the films and the encapsulation of the oils is assured by the presence of a nonionic surfactant and emulsifier T80. The encapsulation of active (antimicrobial and antioxidant) essential oils into the chitosan matrix leads to a significant decrease in the total number of germs for beef meat packed in such films—from 2400–1020 CFU/cm2 for films containing only CS to 700 CFU/cm2 for films containing both CS and clove oil.

The  other', 'components were present in a total amount of less than 13.01%. The chemical composition of the EO analyzed by us is', 'very different from that previously reported in Morocco and Spain for the same species of thyme [11,12]. Similar studies', 'in Poland, Iran, Spain and Italy, respectively, reported as major compounds in the T. vulgaris EO p-cymene, γ-terpinene', 'and thymol [4,13-15]. These differences can be attributed to a large extent to the different chemotypes mentioned above', '[4,5,13].']

WARNING:pyami:['goal of food manufacturers [1]. New processes must be designed to meet the required food product', 'safety or shelf-life demands, and additional hurdles for microorganisms should be introduced. World', 'Health Organization (WHO) reports [2] in recent years estimate that 30% of people in industrialized', 'countries suffer from a food-borne disease each year. Reducing or eliminating food-borne pathogens', 'via “green” consumerism concomitantly with low salt consumption to diminish the incidence of', 'cardiovascular diseases is increasingly becoming a public health concern. On the other hand,', 'antimicrobial resistance affects all areas of health, as many medicinal procedures are related to', 'antibiotics [3].']
WARNING:pyami:['Therefore, new methods and additives should be found to prolong service life and to improve the', 'safety of foods. Recently, effective preventive measures and intelligent preservation methods have', 'been put into place to reduce food spoilage, increase safety, and prolong food shelf-life. One of these', 'methods is bioactive packaging by the use of natural compounds with multifunctional properties both', 'to achieve the protection of food and to improve the health of consumers. The concern regarding', 'safety issues of the synthetic antimicrobial agents has led to the use of essential oils (EOs), which', 'represent eco-friendly alternatives to chemicals. Essential oils (also called volatile oils) are oily liquids', 'obtained from plant materials (ﬂowers, buds, seeds, leaves, twigs, bark, herbs, wood, fruits, and', 'roots). Plant-derived essential oils are complex mixtures of natural volatile compounds resulting', 'from the plant secondary metabolism and extracted from vegetable materials by expression (i.e.,', '“cold pressing”), fermentation, enﬂeurage, or extraction, but the method of distillation with water', 'or steam is the most commonly used for the commercial production of EOs. Essential oils contain', 'important classes of compounds such as monoterpenes (C10 hydrocarbons based on 2 isoprene units),', 'phenylpropanoides (C6 aromatic compounds with C3 side chains), sesquiterpenes (C15 hydrocarbons', 'based on 3 isoprene units), diterpenes (C20), triterpenes (C30) and their oxygenated derivatives, and', 'phenolic compounds (such as thymol and carvacrol). Due to their versatile content, essential oils', 'constitute a rich source of biologically active compounds possessing antimicrobial, antibacterial,', 'antifungal, antioxidant, antiviral, antimycotic, antitoxigenic, antiparasitic, antibiotic, and antiseptic', 'properties and insecticidal activities; therefore, they are useful in a wide range of applications [4,5].']

The  other', 'components were present in a total amount of less than 13.01%. The chemical composition of the EO analyzed by us is', 'very different from that previously reported in Morocco and Spain for the same species of thyme [11,12]. Similar studies', 'in Poland, Iran, Spain and Italy, respectively, reported as major compounds in the T. vulgaris EO p-cymene, γ-terpinene', 'and thymol [4,13-15]. These differences can be attributed to a large extent to the different chemotypes mentioned above', '[4,5,13].']

The  null  hypothesis  that  the  inhibition  zone  is  equal  to  the  disc  diameter  (6  mm)  was  rejected  for  each', 'microorganism at every amount of essential oil with a high significance level (p = 0.00).
